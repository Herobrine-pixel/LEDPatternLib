## üåà LEDPatternLib ‚Äî Versatile LED Pattern Library (NeoPixel Edition)

`LEDPatternLib` is a lightweight, modular Arduino library for displaying various LED animations such as **blink**, **rainbow**, and **Knight Rider** patterns. This version is built specifically for **NeoPixel (WS2812)** LEDs using the [Adafruit NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel).

---

## üîå Features
- Support for NeoPixel WS2812/APA102
- Built-in LED blinking
- Predefined effects: blink, rainbow, knight rider
- Adjustable brightness
- Works with Arduino and PlatformIO
  
---

## üîå Wiring Instructions

### üßæ Requirements
- Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega, ESP32, etc.
- NeoPixel Strip (WS2812 or compatible)
- 470Œ© resistor (recommended for signal line)
- 1000 ¬µF capacitor (recommended across VCC-GND)
- External 5V power supply (if powering many LEDs)

### ü™õ Circuit Connections

### Built-in LED
- No wiring needed if using pin 13 (on most Arduino boards).

| NeoPixel Pin | Connect To Arduino |
|--------------|--------------------|
| **GND**      | GND                |
| **VCC (5V)** | 5V (or external)   |
| **DIN**      | Digital Pin (e.g., D6) via 470Œ© resistor |

üí° **Important:**  
For more than 8‚Äì10 LEDs, use an **external 5V power supply** and **common ground** between Arduino and power supply.

## üì¶ Installation

### Arduino IDE:
1. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library‚Ä¶**
2. Select the downloaded `LEDPatternLib.zip` file
3. Install the **Adafruit NeoPixel** library:  
   Go to **Tools > Manage Libraries**, search for **Adafruit NeoPixel**, and install it.

---
## Example Usage
```cpp
#include <LEDPatternLib.h>
LEDPatternLib led(6, 8); // For NeoPixel
// LEDPatternLib led(13); // For built-in LED

void setup() {
  led.begin();
  led.setBrightness(150);
}

void loop() {
  led.blink(0x00FF00, 500);
  led.knightRider(0xFF0000, 50);
  led.rainbowCycle(10);
}
```

## üß† API Reference

### Constructor:
```cpp
LEDPatternLib(uint8_t pin, uint16_t numPixels);
```

### Methods:
- `void begin();`  
  Initializes the LED strip.

- `void setBrightness(uint8_t brightness);`  
  Set brightness (0‚Äì255).

- `void blink(uint32_t color, uint16_t delay_ms = 500);`  
  Blink with a solid color.

- `void rainbowCycle(uint8_t wait = 20);`  
  Rainbow animation.

- `void knightRider(uint32_t color = 0xFF0000, uint8_t speed = 50);`  
  Knight Rider-style bouncing LED.
